# iowa_counties
Drupal module that creates a vocabulary for iowa_counties and populates it with all 99 counties.

* Install the module like any normal Drupal module. You should now have a vocabulary called "Iowa Counties" with a term for each county.
* If your site already has a vocabulary with a machine name iowa_counties, the module will not enable.
* When you un-install the module, it will delete the iowa_counties vocabulary.
